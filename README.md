# Overview 
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains projects to demonstrate technical writing and documentation skills. Currently I have a totally fake [Security Log Analyzer](security-log-analyzer) project setup that won't actually run, but you can get an idea of how I'd structure a repository, README's and other files. 

I also have [Github Workflow Quickstart](github-workflow-quickstart), which demonstrates my ability to write internal documentation, and write instructional content, including how to structure technical content clearly.
